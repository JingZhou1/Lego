# Lego
The objective of this project is to utilize DOE in order to find the Lego car that travels the farthest when dropped from the top of an inclined ramp 
## 1. Experimental Setup
The entirety of the experiment was carried out in a McCord study room. Thus, a total of 32 runs were carried out here. This includes 2 replications of 16 different factor combinations from 4 factors. These 32 runs were randomized and executed. The factors includes 
- Wheelbase  
- Axle
- Back Wheel Size
- Weight

## 2. Run the experiments and collect data	 
A total of 32 runs were carried out. 

## 3. Data Analysis and Model Adequacy  
Data Analysis and model adequacy checks, including residual analysis to ensure model assumptions are not violated.

## 4. Financial Analysis
A Financial Analysis based on the design of the car and its performance. Are there any trade-offs. Are there any alternatives you would recommend to be more cost effective?
